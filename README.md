Capstone Project: Building a Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant with Machine Learning

This capstone project involves creating a Python-based voice-activated virtual assistant, similar to Siri or Alexa, with integrated machine learning capabilities to improve its responsiveness and predict future tasks based on user behavior.
Take voice commands from the user.
Respond to basic questions (e.g., time, date, weather).
Open applications or websites (e.g., browser, email).
Integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Wolfram Alpha, etc.).


# Key Features:
1. Speech Recognition: Use Google's Speech API to convert voice commands into text.
   - Example: The assistant recognizes commands like "What's the weather?" or "Open Google."

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implement an NLP model to classify user commands into categories such as weather, time, scheduling, or web searches.
   - Example: The assistant categorizes "Tell me the time" as a time-related query and provides the current time.

3. Machine Learning for Command Classification: Use scikit-learn to train a simple model to classify user commands and understand the type of request.
   - Example: A Naive Bayes classifier predicts whether the user wants weather info, web searches, or other types of help.

4. Predictive Behavior: Implement a machine learning model to predict user behavior based on historical usage patterns, allowing the assistant to make proactive suggestions.
   - Example: If the user frequently asks for weather updates every morning, the assistant automatically suggests the weather.

5. Sentiment Analysis: Use simple sentiment analysis to detect the emotional tone of user queries and respond accordingly.
   - Example: If the user says, "I'm tired," the assistant replies, "I hope you get some rest."

# Project Deliverables:		
- Python Source Code that integrates voice commands, machine learning models, and NLP.
- Pre-trained Machine Learning Models for command classification and predictive behavior.
- Documentation detailing how to set up and use the assistant.
- Demo showcasing the assistant responding intelligently to voice commands and making suggestions based on learned behavior.

This simplified project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance the functionality of a voice assistant, making it more responsive and personalized.
